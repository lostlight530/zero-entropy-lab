# DeepEP

DeepEP (DeepEveryParallel) is a high-performance communication library for machine learning training and inference. It provides high-throughput and low-latency expert-parallel (EP) all-to-all GPU kernels for MoE dispatch and combine, including FP8 dispatch, and NVLink weight and gradient exchange for redundant experts. It also offers experimental primitives for pipeline parallelism (PP), context parallelism (CP), data parallelism (DP), and remote memory access (Engram). Communication kernels are compiled at runtime via [DeepJIT](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepJIT), with the supporting extension built during installation.

## News

- **Ascend version release**
  - Same API and full performance on HUAWEI Ascend 950 NPUs
  - Check [DeepEP-Ascend](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP-Ascend) for more details

- **V2.5 release**:
  - Split `ElasticBuffer` into `EPBuffer`, `EngramBuffer`, `PPBuffer`, and `BucketBuffer`, sharing the `BufferBase` lifecycle
  - Add `BufferAllocator` for planning symmetric tensor allocations before buffer construction
  - Add batched all-gather, reduce-scatter, and all-reduce through `BucketBuffer`, with sessions for ordinary PyTorch tensors
  - Add `EPBuffer.lb_prefetch_weights` and `EPBuffer.lb_reduce_grads` for dynamic redundant experts: prefetch expert weights and quantization scales over NVLink before expert computation, then accumulate redundant experts' FP32 gradients into the original experts during backward. These primitives support the expert-replication approach explored by [MoonEP](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoonEP) and [UltraEP](https://github.com/Dots-Infra/UltraEP); see [Expert load balancing](#expert-load-balancing) for the API and integration requirements

### New features

- **JIT-compiled communication kernels** via DeepJIT
- **NCCL Gin backend**
  - Lightweight device-side communication APIs
  - Able to reuse existing NCCL communicators
- **EPv2**
  - High-throughput and low-latency APIs unified into a single `EPBuffer` interface, with an expanded layout for grouped expert GEMMs

### Notes

- EP dispatch and combine require GPU SMs; zero-SM RDMA EP is not supported
- Bucket, Engram, and PP are experimental features
- Engram requires a NCCL build providing `ncclGinOptFlagsWarpGet`

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Linux
- Python 3.10 and above
- NVIDIA Hopper or newer GPUs
- CUDA Toolkit 13.1 and above for DeepJIT compilation, with support for the target GPU
- A C++20 compiler and standard library with `std::format` support
- PyTorch 2.10 and above, with CUDA support
- NCCL 2.32.3 and above
- NVLink for intranode communication
- RDMA network for internode communication

Installation builds the host C++ extension against the CUDA and NCCL libraries. GPU kernels are compiled by DeepJIT for the current device at runtime, so installation does not require a visible GPU or `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST`. Keep the CUDA toolkit and host compiler available at runtime. Automatic bandwidth detection uses `nvidia-smi` and `ibstat`; `BucketBuffer` currently requires both NVLink and RDMA bandwidth to be detectable, even for a group using only one transport.

### Install NCCL dependency

Install the NCCL package matching your CUDA environment so DeepEP can locate its headers and library:

```bash
# CUDA 13.x
python -m pip install "nvidia-nccl-cu13>=2.32.3" --no-deps
# For CUDA 12.x, use nvidia-nccl-cu12 instead
```

For a custom NCCL installation, set `EP_NCCL_ROOT_DIR` to a directory containing `include/` and `lib/`. PyTorch and DeepEP must load the same NCCL shared library. Builds using NCCL headers older than 2.31 additionally require an exact compile-time/runtime NCCL version match.

### Installation

```bash
# Initialize the DeepJIT submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build a wheel and install it into the current Python environment
bash install.sh
```

Then import `deep_ep` in your Python project.

### Development and tests

```bash
# Build and link the extension into the source tree
bash develop.sh

# Run test cases
python tests/ep/test_ep.py
python tests/bucket/test_all_gather.py
python tests/bucket/test_reduce_scatter.py
python tests/bucket/test_all_reduce.py
python tests/buffer/test_allocation.py
python tests/ep/test_prefetch_weights.py
python tests/ep/test_reduce_grads.py
python tests/engram/test_engram.py
python tests/pp/test_pp.py
```

The test scripts require NumPy and spawn local GPU workers. For multi-node tests, launch the same script on each node with a shared `MASTER_ADDR` and `MASTER_PORT`, setting `WORLD_SIZE` to the number of nodes and `RANK` to the node index. These are the conventions of `init_dist` in [deep_ep/utils/envs.py](deep_ep/utils/envs.py); adapt it to your cluster if needed. The tests default to `NCCL_IB_SL=1` and `EP_OVERRIDE_RDMA_SL=1` unless already set. Weight-prefetch and gradient-reduction tests use a single NVLink domain; PP tests require an RDMA-only group.

## Interfaces and examples

### Buffer initialization

High-throughput and low-latency EP operations share a single `EPBuffer` interface. Initialize the buffer with MoE settings directly; SM and QP counts are estimated analytically and can be overridden per call.

Create and reuse a buffer for each EP group. All ranks must agree on `num_max_tokens_per_rank`; choose a common capacity covering the intended training, prefill, and decoding batches. The example below manages one EP group. Finish outstanding operations before replacing its buffer.

```python
import torch.distributed as dist
from typing import Optional

from deep_ep import EPBuffer

# Communication buffer (will allocate at runtime)
_buffer: Optional[EPBuffer] = None

# Number of SMs to use for communication kernels (will be set at buffer creation)
_num_comm_sms: int = 0


def get_buffer(group: dist.ProcessGroup,
               num_max_tokens_per_rank: int,
               hidden: int,
               num_topk: int,
               num_experts: int,
               use_fp8_dispatch: bool = False) -> EPBuffer:
    """Initialize or retrieve the EPBuffer for EP communication."""
    global _buffer, _num_comm_sms

    # Check if we can reuse the existing buffer
    required_bytes = EPBuffer.get_buffer_size_hint(
        group, num_max_tokens_per_rank, hidden,
        num_topk=num_topk, use_fp8_dispatch=use_fp8_dispatch,
    )
    if _buffer is not None and _buffer.group == group and _buffer.num_bytes >= required_bytes:
        _num_comm_sms = _buffer.get_theoretical_num_sms(num_experts, num_topk)
        return _buffer

    # Allocate a new buffer with MoE settings
    _buffer = EPBuffer(
        group,
        num_max_tokens_per_rank=num_max_tokens_per_rank,
        hidden=hidden,
        num_topk=num_topk,
        use_fp8_dispatch=use_fp8_dispatch,
    )

    # Estimate the SM count from the topology and communication volume
    # You may also specify `num_sms` manually in dispatch/combine calls to override
    _num_comm_sms = _buffer.get_theoretical_num_sms(num_experts, num_topk)

    return _buffer
```

### Example use in model training and inference

Training, inference prefilling, and inference decoding use the same `EPBuffer` dispatch and combine APIs. The example uses an expanded layout for grouped expert GEMMs and defers the forward epilogues until the framework waits for their results. Set `expert_alignment` to the grouped GEMM's token alignment; for DeepGEMM, use `deep_gemm.get_mk_alignment_for_contiguous_layout()`.

`do_cpu_sync=True` obtains exact output sizes and CPU-side expert counts, commonly used for training and prefill. Set it to `False` when using GPU-side receive counts, as in decoding: outputs are allocated to the configured capacity, and the expert GEMMs must use `handle.psum_num_recv_tokens_per_expert` to identify valid expert ranges. A new routing decision needs a fresh dispatch; decoding alone does not make an old routing handle reusable.

```python
import torch
from typing import Optional, Tuple, Union

from deep_ep import EPBuffer, EPHandle, EventHandle, EventOverlap


def dispatch_forward(x: Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]],
                     topk_idx: torch.Tensor, topk_weights: torch.Tensor,
                     num_experts: int,
                     num_max_tokens_per_rank: int,
                     expert_alignment: int = 1,
                     do_cpu_sync: bool = True,
                     previous_event: Optional[EventHandle] = None) -> EventOverlap:
    """

    """
    global _buffer, _num_comm_sms

    return _buffer.dispatch(
        x,
        topk_idx=topk_idx,
        topk_weights=topk_weights,

    combined_grad_x, combined_grad_topk_weights, event = _buffer.combine(

        handle=handle,
        bias=bias,
        topk_weights=grad_recv_topk_weights,

        async_with_compute_stream=True,
        allocate_on_comm_stream=previous_event is not None,
        defer_epilogue=True,
    )


def combine_backward(grad_combined_x: Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]],
                     handle: EPHandle) -> \
        Tuple[Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]], EventOverlap]:
    """The backward pass of MoE combine is actually a dispatch."""
    global _buffer, _num_comm_sms

    grad_x, _, _, _, event = _buffer.dispatch(
        grad_combined_x,

        num_sms=_num_comm_sms,
        async_with_compute_stream=True,
        do_expand=True,
        do_zero_padding=True,
        use_tma_aligned_col_major_sf=True,
    )

    return grad_x, event
```

For communication-computation overlap, launch communication first and wait at the point where the expert computation needs its results:

```python
# Use do_cpu_sync=False for decoding with GPU-side expert counts
event = dispatch_forward(...)

# ... do some independent computation here ...

# Run the deferred dispatch epilogue and obtain its results
recv_x, _, recv_topk_weights, handle = event.current_stream_wait()

# ... run the expert GEMMs and apply recv_topk_weights to produce expert_output ...
event = combine_forward(expert_output, handle)

# ... do some independent computation here ...
combined_x, _ = event.current_stream_wait()
```

The expanded `recv_topk_weights` is one-dimensional, with one value per expert row. The expert computation applies these router weights before combine; combine sums the supplied expert outputs. Combine inputs must be BF16. `bias` can add the shared-expert output or residual during the combine epilogue.

Training saves the forward `handle` for `combine_backward` and `dispatch_backward`. The backward helpers above return tensors and an event; wait on that event before using the tensors. Cached dispatch replays the saved expanded layout without another receive-count CPU synchronization. Keep the original `topk_idx` unchanged until all uses of the handle finish.

### Deferred epilogues

Dispatch and combine accept `defer_epilogue=True` together with `async_with_compute_stream=True`. In this mode, the call returns an `EventOverlap` directly. Calling `.wait()` runs the deferred epilogue on the current stream and returns `(recv_x, recv_topk_idx, recv_topk_weights, handle)` for dispatch, or `(combined_x, combined_topk_weights)` for combine.

The returned result is produced by the first wait, so retain it for the following computation. Without other work to overlap, call `.wait()` immediately. `do_zero_padding=True` clears alignment gaps between experts; in the no-CPU-sync mode, it does not make unused output capacity valid data.

If independent computation is already queued before the communication call, capture the input-ready event with `_buffer.capture()` before enqueueing that computation and pass it as `previous_event`. The forward helpers set `allocate_on_comm_stream=True` in this case, as required by EP. The deferred epilogue still runs on the current stream at `.wait()`; this also allows a combine `bias` produced by the intervening computation to be consumed there.

### Bucket collectives (experimental)

`BucketBuffer` provides batched `all_gather`, `reduce_scatter`, and `all_reduce` for CP and DP workloads. In normal usage, inputs must reside in the bucket's own storage. Use `BufferAllocator` to plan tensors before creating the buffer. The plan's meta tensors become CUDA views into the buffer when it is constructed.

```python
import torch

from deep_ep import BufferAllocator, BucketBuffer

# group is an initialized CP or DP process group
allocation_plan = BufferAllocator()
x = allocation_plan.allocate((group.size(), 1024), torch.float32)
buffer = BucketBuffer(group, allocation_plan)

# Gather each rank's local shard into the registered tensor
x[group.rank()].fill_(group.rank())
gathered_x = buffer.all_gather(x[group.rank()]).wait()

# Reduce-scatter and all-reduce use FP32 tensors in the buffer
x.fill_(1)
shard = buffer.reduce_scatter(x).wait()
x.fill_(1)
reduced_x = buffer.all_reduce(x).wait()
```

All ranks must use the same allocation plan. Each collective also accepts a list of tensors, and `.wait()` returns the corresponding tensor or list of tensors. Results are views into the buffer; all-gather returns flattened views. Reduce-scatter and all-reduce accept FP32 inputs and sum contributions by default; use `scale` to scale the result. Reduce-scatter also supports `comm_precision="bf16"` for lower-precision communication while retaining FP32 input and output tensors.

To use tensors allocated outside the bucket, wrap the collective calls in a `buffer.session()`. The session manages temporary bucket storage and the required staging copies:

```python
with buffer.session():
    reduced_x = buffer.all_reduce(external_x).wait()
    # Consume or copy reduced_x before reusing the session storage
```

The NVLink-only all-gather path also supports an external source with an explicitly supplied in-bucket `dsts`; use a session for general out-of-bucket inputs.

All three collectives support NVLink, RDMA, and hybrid domains. NVLink reductions require NCCL multimem support. All-gather is driven by copy engines (`num_sms=0`); reduce-scatter and all-reduce use GPU SMs. See [the bucket tests](tests/bucket) and [allocation tests](tests/buffer/test_allocation.py) for examples, including registration with multiple communication groups.

### Expert load balancing

Dynamic expert replication spreads a heavily loaded expert's computation across additional GPUs. [MoonEP](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/MoonEP) explores online planning with dynamic redundant experts, weight prefetching, and gradient reduction. [UltraEP](https://github.com/Dots-Infra/UltraEP) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.04101)) plans replication and token rerouting from the current post-gating load, keeping expert replication within the NVLink domain. These works motivate the redundant-expert communication primitives exposed by `EPBuffer`.

- `lb_prefetch_weights(redundant_expert_weights, expert_weights, redundancy_mapping)` pushes original expert weights to the requested redundant slots before expert computation. It accepts one tensor or matching nonempty tensor sequences, so weights and quantization scales can be transferred together without dtype conversion.
- `lb_reduce_grads(redundant_expert_grads, expert_grads, redundancy_mapping)` reads the redundant experts' FP32 gradients over NVLink and adds them into the original experts' gradients in place. Use the same mapping as the forward pass and initialize `expert_grads` with the local contribution, or zeros, before reduction.

The caller supplies the replication plan, reroutes tokens to the chosen expert instances, and manages the expert GEMMs. Both exchange operations are collective within each NVLink domain: every rank in that domain must call them, including ranks with no assigned redundant slots. They run asynchronously on the communication stream and return an `EventOverlap`; call `.wait()` before consuming their results. `previous_event` can specify when the inputs are ready, and `num_sms=0` selects an analytical SM estimate.

Reserve redundant weight and gradient storage with `lb_allocation_plan_or_num_bytes`, using a `BufferAllocator` plan or an aligned byte count. This LB region is separate from the EP dispatch/combine buffer. The redundant tensors must reside in it; original expert weights and gradients can use ordinary CUDA allocations. Plans must have the same shapes and allocation order on every rank in the NVLink domain.

`redundancy_mapping` must be a contiguous CUDA int32 tensor of shape `[num_nvlink_ranks, num_redundant_experts]`, with identical contents on every rank in the domain. Entry `[r, c]` assigns an expert to redundant slot `c` on domain-local rank `r`, or is `-1` for an unused slot. Expert IDs are `owner_rank * num_local_experts + local_expert_idx`, using domain-local rank indices. Assign replicas to peers; a rank's own experts must not appear in its redundant slots. Unused slots are skipped.

All weight and gradient tensors must be contiguous CUDA tensors. Weight tensors have leading dimension `num_local_experts` and redundant tensors `num_redundant_experts`; the trailing shapes may differ as long as each matching pair has the same byte count per expert, a multiple of `deep_ep.get_num_tma_alignment()` (32 bytes). All ranks in the domain must have the same `num_local_experts`. Gradient reduction takes two-dimensional FP32 tensors; flatten each expert's parameters into a row with the same byte alignment.

```python
import torch

from deep_ep import BufferAllocator, EPBuffer

# Use the same plan on every rank; each example expert row is 1024 elements
lb_plan = BufferAllocator()
redundant_weights = lb_plan.allocate((num_redundant_experts, 1024), torch.bfloat16)
redundant_grads = lb_plan.allocate((num_redundant_experts, 1024), torch.float32)
buffer = EPBuffer(
    group,
    num_max_tokens_per_rank=num_max_tokens_per_rank,
    hidden=hidden,
    num_topk=num_topk,
    lb_allocation_plan_or_num_bytes=lb_plan,
)

# expert_weights: contiguous CUDA BF16 [num_local_experts, 1024]
# redundancy_mapping: supplied by the caller's replication planner
weights_ready = buffer.lb_prefetch_weights(
    redundant_weights, expert_weights, redundancy_mapping,
)
# ... independent computation can overlap the exchange ...
weights_ready.wait()
# ... run expert computation using the prefetched weights ...

# After backward has written redundant_grads and the local expert_grads:
grads_ready = buffer.lb_reduce_grads(
    redundant_grads, expert_grads, redundancy_mapping,
)
# ... independent backward computation can overlap the reduction ...
grads_ready.wait()
# expert_grads now includes contributions from all redundant instances
```

Keep the mapping and tensor storage valid until the corresponding exchange finishes. If redundant storage is reused across layers or microbatches, restore the required weights before backward computation and finish gradient reduction before reusing its inputs. Reduction does not clear redundant gradients; overwrite or zero them before the next accumulation. See [weight prefetch tests](tests/ep/test_prefetch_weights.py) and [gradient reduction tests](tests/ep/test_reduce_grads.py) for complete allocation and correctness examples.

### Engram (experimental)

`EngramBuffer` supports GPU/CPU storage and multi-layer fetches over RDMA. Use `get_storage_size_hint` and `get_theoretical_config` to size the buffer and its QPs, then `set_config` and `write` to populate the layer tables.

`fetch(indices)` takes an int32 tensor of shape `[num_layers, num_tokens, num_entries_per_token]` and returns one completion hook per layer. Call the corresponding hook before using that layer's fetched data. See [Engram tests](tests/engram/test_engram.py) for BF16, FP8, and CPU storage examples.

### Pipeline parallelism (experimental)

`PPBuffer` provides `send(x, dst_rank_idx)` and `recv(x, src_rank_idx)` between adjacent ranks in an RDMA-only pipeline group. Set `num_max_tensor_bytes` and `num_max_inflight_tensors` at construction to reserve the send/recv slots. Inputs and outputs must be contiguous CUDA tensors with 32-byte-aligned pointers and sizes. See [PP tests](tests/pp/test_pp.py) for usage.

### Environment variables

Set runtime variables before importing `deep_ep` and creating buffers. Flags use `0`/`1` unless noted. The defaults below assume no build-time defaults have been packaged.

**Runtime and networking**

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EP_BUFFER_DEBUG` | Unset | Set to `1` to print initialization, topology, buffer-size, and SM-estimation diagnostics. Leave unset to disable all diagnostics; Python-side checks also treat the string `"0"` as enabled. |
| `EP_SUPPRESS_NCCL_CHECK` | `0` | Skip the import-time checks for duplicate NCCL libraries and binary equality with the selected installation. Does not bypass the C++ device-communicator compatibility checks. |
| `EP_AVOID_RECORD_STREAM` | `0` | For EP and bucket operations, retain tensors in the completion event instead of calling `record_stream`. Keep the event alive until communication has completed. |
| `EP_REUSE_NCCL_COMM` | `1` | Reuse the PyTorch process group's NCCL communicator when its backend exposes `_comm_ptr`; otherwise create a DeepEP-managed communicator. |
| `EP_DEFAULT_RDMA_SL` | Unset | Set the Gin traffic class/service level when the buffer's `sl_idx` is not supplied. If both are unset, use NCCL's default. |
| `EP_OVERRIDE_RDMA_SL` | Unset | Override both `EP_DEFAULT_RDMA_SL` and the buffer's `sl_idx`. |
| `EP_DISABLE_GIN` | `0` | Skip Gin initialization for NVLink-only use. RDMA operations require Gin; this flag does not select another RDMA backend. |
| `EP_NUM_MAX_LOCAL_RANKS` | `16` | Engram only: estimate registered storage for `NCCL_WIN_STRIDE` sizing in hybrid mode. This is a sizing estimate, not a rank-count limit. |

**JIT compilation**

DeepJIT reads `EP_JIT_*` first, then the corresponding `DJ_JIT_*` variable as a global fallback. Configure these before the first kernel compilation. An explicit `EP_JIT_*` value, including a packaged default, takes precedence over `DJ_JIT_*`.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EP_JIT_DEBUG` | `0` | Enable compiler-command and kernel-load diagnostics, PTXAS output, source line information, and PTX/SASS dumps. |
| `EP_JIT_CACHE_DIR` | `$HOME/.dj` | Cache root or colon-separated list of roots. Search all roots in order and write newly compiled artifacts to the first. |
| `EP_JIT_NVCC_COMPILER` | Detected toolkit's `bin/nvcc` | Override the NVCC executable; a valid CUDA toolkit root must still be discoverable. |
| `EP_JIT_CPP_STANDARD` | `20` | C++ standard passed to NVCC. DeepEP requires C++20 or newer. |
| `EP_JIT_PRINT_COMPILER_COMMAND` | `0` | Print compiler and disassembler commands. |
| `EP_JIT_PRINT_LOAD_TIME` | `0` | Print kernel-binary loading time. |
| `EP_JIT_PTXAS_VERBOSE` | `0` | Enable and print detailed PTXAS output. |
| `EP_JIT_CHECK_NO_SPILLS` | `0` | Reject compiled kernels with register spills. |
| `EP_JIT_CHECK_NO_LOCAL_MEMORY` | `0` | Reject compiled kernels with local-memory usage. |
| `EP_JIT_WITH_LINEINFO` | `0` | Embed source line information for profiling. |
| `EP_JIT_DUMP_ASM` | `0` | Generate both PTX and SASS artifacts on a cache miss. |
| `EP_JIT_DUMP_PTX` | `0` | Generate PTX artifacts on a cache miss. |
| `EP_JIT_DUMP_SASS` | `0` | Generate SASS artifacts on a cache miss; requires the toolkit's `cuobjdump`. |
| `EP_GIN_GDAKI_DEBUG` | `0` | Compile JIT kernels with NCCL Gin GDAKI device debugging enabled. |

DeepJIT discovers the CUDA toolkit through `CUDA_HOME`, then `CUDA_PATH`, then `nvcc` on `PATH`, and finally `/usr/local/cuda`.

**Build and dependency discovery**

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EP_NCCL_ROOT_DIR` | Auto-detected | NCCL installation with `include/` and `lib/`, used at build and import time. Takes precedence over `NCCL_DIR`, then NVIDIA Python package discovery. |
| `EP_NUM_TOPK_IDX_BITS` | `64` | Build-time top-k index width (`32` or `64`). Use the exported `deep_ep.topk_idx_t` for routing indices. Changing this value requires rebuilding the extension. |

When set during a package build, these variables are stored as import-time defaults: `EP_JIT_CACHE_DIR`, `EP_JIT_PRINT_COMPILER_COMMAND`, `EP_JIT_CPP_STANDARD`, `EP_NUM_TOPK_IDX_BITS`, `EP_NCCL_ROOT_DIR`, `EP_DEFAULT_RDMA_SL`, and `EP_OVERRIDE_RDMA_SL`. Existing environment values take precedence at import. Overriding `EP_NUM_TOPK_IDX_BITS` at runtime does not change the compiled index type.

**Test profiling**

These flags affect `bench_kineto` in [deep_ep/utils/testing.py](deep_ep/utils/testing.py), not production communication:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EP_USE_NVIDIA_TOOLS` | `0` | Skip the internal profiler when using Nsight or Compute Sanitizer. Reported internal timings are placeholders while this is enabled. |
| `EP_DISABLE_BARRIER_PROFILING` | `0` | Disable the barrier and delay inserted before each profiled iteration. |

## Network configurations

DeepEP is fully tested with InfiniBand networks. However, it is theoretically compatible with RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) as well.

### Traffic isolation

Traffic isolation is supported by InfiniBand through Virtual Lanes (VL).

To prevent interference between different types of traffic, we recommend segregating workloads across different virtual lanes as follows:

- expert-parallel workloads
- other workloads

Select the RDMA service level through the buffer's `sl_idx` argument. The precedence is `EP_OVERRIDE_RDMA_SL` > `sl_idx` > `EP_DEFAULT_RDMA_SL` > NCCL's default. The fabric's SL-to-VL mapping determines which virtual lane carries that traffic.

### Adaptive routing

Adaptive routing is an advanced routing feature provided by InfiniBand switches that can evenly distribute traffic across multiple paths. Even though adaptive routing introduces additional latency, we still recommend enabling it under all network load conditions.

### Congestion control

For maximum-bandwidth workloads, we recommend disabling congestion control after validating the fabric configuration. If congestion is unavoidable, place those workloads on lower-priority virtual lanes. DeepEP does not configure congestion control on the fabric.

### PCI atomic mode

If the hardware supports it, we recommend using the following command to set the NIC's `PCI_ATOMIC_MODE` to improve RDMA atomic operation performance:

```bash
# Replace mlx5_0 with the target NIC
sudo mlxconfig -y -d mlx5_0 set PCI_ATOMIC_MODE=4
```
