# Dify 1.15.0 Release Note

## What's Changed

### UX & UI Enhancements

<img width="1920" height="1044" alt="录屏2026-06-25 21 12 33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3ac7394-2ccf-4a66-873a-b7224a16897a" />


- **Redesigned landing / onboarding** for an easier first-run experience (#37433, #37844, #37800)
- **Faster navigation** — improved "go to anything" palette and autofocused search inputs (#32130, #37175)
- **Safer deletes** — one-click confirmation before removing an app (#37263)
- **Cleaner workflow editor** with collapsible panels (#37276)
- **Clearer notifications** — consistent toasts that show long errors in full (#37382, #37581)
- **More accessible** — plugin permission hints, restored contact-us menu, skip-nav link, and keyboard focus polish (#37310, #37774, #37644)

### New Features
**difyctl — drive Dify from the command line**
- difyctl is a command-line client for Dify: you can now run apps and workflows straight from your terminal, so personal agents, scripts, and CI pipelines can invoke Dify workflows without opening the web UI (#37036)
- Install it on any platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) with a single command and no access token — binaries are published as public releases with checksum verification (#37036, #37454)
- Pass scoped environment variables to CLI tool runs, and get clearer, consistent error messages (including friendly rate-limit handling) across both difyctl and the `/openapi/v1` API (#37324, #37285, #37313, #36896)

**See CoT in Workflow & Chatflow & CLI**
- Chat Flow / Workflow can now stream the model's reasoning into a dedicated live "thinking" panel while keeping the final answer clean and readable. The reasoning is preserved so it's still there after a page refresh, and the same reasoning is visible in CLI and workflow run previews (#37460, #37828)

**Richer Human-in-the-Loop forms**
- When a workflow pauses to ask a person for input, the form can now include dropdown selects and file / multi-file uploads — not just free text — so people can answer with structured choices and attachments (#36322)

**Support for slow, long-running models**
- Workflows can now use generation models that take a long time to respond (such as image or video generation) via a polling mechanism: the node patiently waits for the final result instead of timing out (#37462)

**Knowledge from richer spreadsheets**
- Images embedded inside Excel files are now extracted during knowledge import, so spreadsheet content that relies on pictures (diagrams, screenshots, charts) is no longer lost (#37104)

**Deeper observability**
- Set your own trace session id for Phoenix so traces line up with your application's sessions, and follow document-retrieval steps in traces to understand how RAG results were produced (#37056, #37283)

**Workflow authoring polish**
- A refreshed start node makes it clearer how a workflow begins, and a smarter output node gives you more control over what a workflow returns (#37348, #35511)
- Friendlier errors when an app or workspace ID is malformed, instead of confusing failures (#37212)

**Faster plugin installs in certain regions**
- The plugin daemon now auto-detects your region at startup and, where network connectivity to PyPI is poor, automatically picks a nearby package mirror — so installing plugins is faster and more reliable without any manual setup. You can still pin a specific mirror if you prefer (dify-plugin-daemon#750)

### Security Updates

This release fixes a path traversal issue in plugin-daemon forwarding (cve-2026-41948).

### Bug Fixes
- Hardened outbound HTTP with bounded timeouts for Firecrawl, Jina, Watercrawl, Nacos, and Marketplace requests, and hardened default SSRF proxy egress (#37638, #37637, #37515, #37444, #37424, #36332)
- Fixed Lindorm vector store errors caused by the `opensearch-py` update (#37862) and Tongyi credential compatibility (#37942)
- Invalidated credential cache after OAuth refresh (#37630)
- Improved workflow execution error handling, eagerly validated conversations to prevent hanging, and prevented legacy stop from interrupting GraphEngine runs (#37919, #37224, #37129)
- Resolved `DetachedInstanceError` via session management refactoring (#37847) and stabilized deployment state hydration (#37818)
- Fixed conversation variable description length validation to prevent `varchar(255)` truncation (#33038) and stored Chinese as unicode so search works (#37446)
- Numerous web UI and accessibility/focus-ring polish fixes

### Improvements
- Refactored session management across services to accept `db.session` explicitly via dependency injection for consistency (#37639, #37832, #37695, #37694, and related)
- Modernized typing (removed redundant `type: ignore`/`cast`, converted ABCs to `Protocol`, replaced `isinstance` chains with `match-case`)
- Reduced workflow startup latency for Chatflow (#36773) and lowered workflow termination latency so stopping a run takes effect faster (#37106, #37129)
- Upgraded dependencies for CVE fixes (Bleach, PyJWT, starlette, storage group) (#37860, #37008, #37076, #37861)

## Environment Variable Changes

### Added
- `DEVICE_FLOW_APPROVE_RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` (`docker/envs/core-services/shared.env.example`)
- `DIFY_ENV_NACOS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, `DIFY_ENV_NACOS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` (`api/.env.example`)
- `ENABLE_LEARN_APP` (`api/.env.example`)
- `ENABLE_OAUTH_BEARER` (`docker/envs/core-services/shared.env.example`)
- `MILVUS_SECURE`, `MILVUS_SERVER_NAME`, `MILVUS_SERVER_PEM_PATH` (`docker/envs/vectorstores/milvus.env.example`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FEATURE_PREVIEW` (`docker/envs/core-services/web.env.example`)
- `OPENAPI_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS`, `OPENAPI_ENABLED`, `OPENAPI_KNOWN_CLIENT_IDS`, `OPENAPI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_TOKEN` (`docker/envs/core-services/shared.env.example`)
- `PLUGIN_MODEL_PROVIDERS_CACHE_TTL` (`api/.env.example`)
- `SERVER_CONSOLE_API_URL` (`docker/.env.example`)
- `SSRF_PROXY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_DOMAINS`, `SSRF_PROXY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS`, `SSRF_SANDBOX_PROXY_HOST`, `SSRF_SANDBOX_PROXY_PORT` (`docker/envs/middleware.env.example`)
-  `PIP_MIRROR_AUTO_DETECT` (plugin daemon; default `true`) — auto-select a nearby PyPI mirror at startup for regions with poor connectivity
- `PIP_MIRROR_URL` (plugin daemon; default empty) — manually pin the PyPI mirror; takes precedence over auto-detection


### Removed
- `SSRF_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`, `SSRF_SANDBOX_HOST` (`docker/envs/middleware.env.example`)

### Modified
- `UV_CACHE_DIR`: `/tmp/.uv-cache` → `/tmp/uv_cache`

### Docker Compose Files
- `docker/docker-compose.yaml` (modified)
- `docker/docker-compose.middleware.yaml` (modified)
- `docker/docker-compose.pytest.ports.yaml` (added)

## Database Migrations

This release includes new database migrations. Run `flask db upgrade` (or `uv run --project api flask db upgrade`) after updating the code. Notable schema additions:
- OAuth access tokens (`ENABLE_OAUTH_BEARER`)
- Credential visibility
- Human Input upload tables and conversation linkage
- **Category-scoped plugin auto-upgrade strategy** (`add_plugin_auto_upgrade_category`)
- App stars, learn-dify / cloud-only flags on recommended apps
- Normalized legacy end-user type

## Upgrade Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This release includes new database migrations. Run them as part of the upgrade.
> - **Plugin auto-upgrade is now configured per plugin category.** After running `flask db upgrade`, you MUST also run `flask backfill-plugin-auto-upgrade` to migrate existing tenants' auto-upgrade settings into the new category-scoped model. If you skip this step, plugin auto-upgrade settings users previously configured may stop taking effect.
> - Environment variables changed (19 added, 2 removed, 1 modified). Review the Environment Variable Changes section and update your `.env` accordingly.
> - Docker Compose configuration files changed. If you maintain a customized `docker-compose.yaml`, review the changes and re-apply local customizations carefully.
