## 🚀 What's New in v1.14.2?

v1.14.2 is a patch release focused on security hardening, workflow and knowledge reliability, observability fixes, agent groundwork, and deployment/runtime tuning after v1.14.1.

### 🔐 Security and administration

- **Tenant-scoped sensitive endpoints** — strengthened tenant isolation for app trace-config endpoints and FilePreview text extraction. Thanks @xr843 in [#35793](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/35793) and [#35797](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/35797).
- **Tool credential safety** — restricted default builtin tool credential updates to workspace admins and owners, and cleaned stale tenant tool credentials during `reset-encrypt-key-pair`. Thanks @NeatGuyCoding and @xr843 in [#36264](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36264) and [#35843](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/35843).

### 🧩 Workflow, HITL, and app runtime

- **Workflow execution reliability** — restored tracing after HITL workflow resume, improved workflow run callback tracking, reduced message-update database roundtrips, fixed memory fetches outside Flask context, and closed base64 file lookup sessions correctly. Thanks @Blackoutta, @CodingOnStar, @wylswz, @hjlarry, and @escape0707 in [#36064](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36064), [#36149](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36149), [#36213](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36213), [#36253](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36253), and [#36308](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36308).
- **Workflow and model selection polish** — fixed loading behavior when no model is selected, filtered model presets by supported parameters, and improved API extension dialog controls. Thanks @iamjoel and @lyzno1 in [#36342](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36342), [#36339](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36339), and [#36323](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36323).

### 📚 Data, RAG, and knowledge

- **Knowledge-base stability** — fixed knowledge hit-testing rendering, empty knowledge creation, recommended app category ordering, and null handling in recommended app detail retrieval. Thanks @FFXN, @laipz8200, @hjlarry, and @EvanYao826 in [#36106](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36106), [#36336](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36336), [#36161](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36161), and [#36153](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36153).
- **RAG and document processing** — allowed LLM nodes to access retrieved knowledge files, regenerated document summaries after API updates, fixed pipeline template rendering, and handled credential fetch failures in RAG pipelines more gracefully. Thanks @laipz8200, @EvanYao826, @FFXN, and @linw1995 in [#36175](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36175), [#36035](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36035), [#36168](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36168), and [#36165](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36165).

### 🎨 Web UI and product experience

- **App creation and onboarding** — tracked app creation source and template ID, initialized user timezone and language from the browser, and fixed WebApp icon and description display. Thanks @CodingOnStar, @lyzno1, and @JzoNgKVO in [#36369](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36369), [#36170](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36170), [#36206](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36206), and [#36209](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36209).
- **Annotation and datasets UI** — allowed annotation reply score thresholds below `0.8`, redirected unauthorized knowledge editors back to datasets, and fixed tag rename without type payload. Thanks @JzoNgKVO, @iamjoel, and @lyzno1 in [#36337](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36337), [#36073](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36073), and [#36182](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36182).
- **UI platform migration and polish** — added Checkbox and CheckboxGroup primitives, migrated more controls to `@langgenius/dify-ui`, improved dialog overflow layouts, and refined account avatar and install-flow interactions. Thanks @lyzno1 and @CodingOnStar in [#36271](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36271), [#36295](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36295), [#36255](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36255), [#36302](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36302), [#36111](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36111), [#36199](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36199), and [#36210](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36210).

### 🔎 Observability and tracing

- **Tracing reliability** — isolated Langfuse v3 SDK tracer providers to prevent cross-task interference and added Phoenix parent trace fallback behavior. Thanks @GareArc and @Blackoutta in [#36136](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36136) and [#36290](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36290).

### ⚙️ Deployment, dependencies, and developer experience

- **Deployment tuning** — upgraded plugin-daemon to `0.6.1`, increased the default GraphEngine minimum worker count, and refreshed Docker README references. Thanks @laipz8200, @kenwoodjw, and @RiskeyL in [#36312](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36312), [#35650](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/35650), and [#36303](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/36303).

## Upgrade Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This release includes a new database migration for configurable Explore app categories. Run database migrations as part of the upgrade.
> - Docker Compose environment variables are now split into categorized files under `docker/envs/**`. If you maintain a customized `docker-compose.yaml` or `.env`, review the new layout and re-apply local customizations carefully.
> - For self-hosted deployments, explicitly configured `SECRET_KEY` values continue to be respected. If `SECRET_KEY` is empty, Dify now generates and persists a runtime key automatically.

### Docker Compose Deployments

1. Back up your customized docker-compose YAML and env files.

   ```bash
   cd docker
   cp docker-compose.yaml docker-compose.yaml.$(date +%s).bak
   cp .env .env.$(date +%s).bak 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

2. Get the latest code from the release branch or tag.

   ```bash
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout 1.14.2
   ```

3. Stop the service. Please execute in the `docker` directory.

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

4. Back up data.

   ```bash
   tar -cvf volumes-$(date +%s).tgz volumes
   ```

5. Review the new `docker/envs/**` env file layout and re-apply any local customizations.

6. Upgrade services.

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### Source Code Deployments

1. Stop the API server, Worker, and Web frontend Server.

2. Get the latest code from the release tag.

   ```bash
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout 1.14.2
   ```

3. Update Python dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd api
   uv sync
   ```

4. Run the migration script.

   ```bash
   uv run flask db upgrade
