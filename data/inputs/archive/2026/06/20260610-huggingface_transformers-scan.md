## New Model additions

### DiffusionGemma

DiffusionGemma is engineered to reduce the sequential bottlenecks of standard causal language models by employing an encoder-decoder architecture specifically optimized for inference speed. During inference, DiffusionGemma leverages multi-canvas sampling, where rather than generating one token at a time, the model iteratively denoises a full block of tokens using a diffusion sampler. This block-autoregressive approach facilitates text generation at higher speeds compared to traditional sequential generation methods.

DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp is an experimental model from DeepSeek-AI that introduces DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), a trainable, fine-grained sparse attention mechanism designed to improve training and inference efficiency in long-context scenarios. Built on top of DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus with a 685B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts backbone, it reduces the quadratic cost of attention over long sequences by attending only to a selected subset of past tokens while maintaining virtually identical benchmark performance. The work was extended in DeepSeek-V3.2 which pairs DSA with scalable reinforcement learning and achieves gold-medal level results on competition math and competitive programming benchmarks.

* Add deepseek 3.2 exp (#41251) by @ArthurZucker in [#41251](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/41251)


## Kernels

The `KernelConfig` API was extended to support n-to-1 module fusion and parameter transformation, simplifying how custom kernels are integrated with Transformers modules. Additional fixes include resolving a dtype mismatch in the Mamba2 CUDA kernel path for NemotronH/Zamba2, adding fine-grained fp8/fp4 Triton kernel support, and correcting the FalconMamba fast-path warning to recommend `pip install kernels` instead of `mamba-ssm`.
