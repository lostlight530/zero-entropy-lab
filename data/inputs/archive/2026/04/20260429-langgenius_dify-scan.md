## 🚀 What's New in v1.14.0?

### Collaboration
<img width="2632" height="1190" alt="img_v3_02117_67a67218-1ae5-4d68-a45b-3ada592f87fg" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d4a3660-8a6a-4b29-9766-4d5b5fd9a51b" />

Collaboration allows workspace members to edit the same workflow together, with synced graph updates, online presence, and shared visibility into who is working where.

On self-hosted deployments, collaboration is turned off by default. Enable it by setting:

```
ENABLE_COLLABORATION_MODE = true
SERVER_WORKER_CLASS = geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL = your deployment’s WebSocket URL (e.g., wss://dify.example.com)
```

For more details, see [Full Documentation](https://docs.dify.ai/en/use-dify/build/workflow-collaboration)

### Human-in-the-loop (HITL)

- **Service API for HITL** — programmatic support for human-in-the-loop flows alongside existing console behavior.

### MCP and plugins

- **MCP tool metadata** — refresh after updates so the UI stays in sync.
- **MCP server URL** — fix double `/v1` that could break OAuth and authorization (404).
- **MCP OAuth discovery** — handle malformed JSON safely.
- **MCP schema publishing** — map `checkbox` and `json_object` types correctly.
- **Plugins** — auto-upgrade strategy persistence, local installer and file-input behavior, tenant scoping for inner API end-user lookup.

### Marketplace and OAuth

- **Marketplace and OAuth** — targeted fixes for marketplace flows and OAuth sign-in (including edge cases such as null email on GitHub OAuth).

### UI kit and front-end platform

- **`@langgenius/dify-ui`** — shared primitives (for example **PreviewCard**, **Meter**), design tokens, and broad migration from ad-hoc `web/base/ui` toward the package.
- **Accessibility** — date and time pickers, auto-update strategy picker, scrollbars in plugin and model selectors, and related polish.
- **Goto Anything** — recent items, `/go` command, deeper app sub-sections; fix for **Cmd+K** (removed problematic dynamic import).
- **Prompt editor** — slash-triggered **variable filtering**; keyboard **up/down** in variable lists.
- **Follow-up questions** — improved settings and token limits for suggested questions.
- **Modals** — ApiKey, provider config, and others refactored toward a shared **Dialog** pattern with tests.

### Observability and analytics
- **Langfuse** — optional **time-to-first-token (TTFT)** reporting.
- **Explore** — banner impression tracking; app preview event tracking on cards.

### Billing and quotas

- **Quota v3** integration in the product stack.
- **Billing UI** — Meter-based usage presentation; more resilient cleanup when billing APIs fail.
- **File uploader** — billing-aware behavior and copy updates.

### Data, RAG, and knowledge

- **Summary index and Weaviate** — compatibility fixes when using the summary index with Weaviate.
- **Vector projection** — include `is_summary` and `original_chunk_id` in default projection where relevant.
- **External and bound datasets** — stronger tenant checks on knowledge APIs.

### Infrastructure and operations

- **Docker Compose** — **healthchecks** for `api`, `worker`, and `worker_beat`; template and env example updates (for example S3 address style).
- **Celery** — default worker **concurrency raised to 4**; missing queue fix.
- **PostgreSQL** — higher default **max connections (200)** for the updated app DB path.
- **Redis** — **configurable key prefix**; **retry** logic for Redis operations.
- **TiDB** — endpoint support and related auth binding migration (**Qdrant endpoint on TiDB auth bindings**).
- **Markdown** — optional **`ALLOW_INLINE_STYLES`** environment variable to allow inline CSS in rendered Markdown when needed.

### Security

- **Change-email flow** — stricter phase-bound token handling ([GHSA-4q3w-q5mc-45rq](https://github.com/advisories?query=GHSA-4q3w-q5mc-45rq)).
- **IDOR hardening** — tenant validation on data-source binding; dataset and API ownership checks where gaps were found.

### Performance
- Optimized performance of graph initialization.

### API and platform internals

- **Graphon** — upgrade to standalone **Graphon 0.2.2** (replacing in-tree `dify_graph` naming and packaging).
- **OpenAPI** — script to generate **OpenAPI v2** JSON and documentation pointer.
- **Deprecation** — some legacy console APIs marked deprecated in favor of newer patterns.
- Large **SQLAlchemy 2.0** `select()` migration, **Pydantic `BaseModel`** for many console and service responses, and **testcontainers**-based tests for stability.
