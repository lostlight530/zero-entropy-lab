Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT) is a lightweight encoder-only model for online video segmentation built on a plain Vision Transformer (ViT). It eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules by introducing a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames and employs a query fusion strategy that combines propagated queries with temporally-agnostic learned queries. VidEoMT achieves competitive accuracy while being 5x-10x faster than existing approaches, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

UVDoc is a machine learning model designed for document image rectification and correction. The main purpose of this model is to carry out geometric transformation on images to correct document distortion, inclination, perspective deformation and other problems in document images. It provides both single input and batched inference capabilities for processing distorted document images.

The Jina-Embeddings-v3 is a multilingual, multi-task text embedding model designed for a variety of NLP applications. Based on the XLM-RoBERTa architecture, this model supports Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) replacing absolute position embeddings to support long input sequences up to 8192 tokens. Additionally, it features 5 built-in Task-Specific LoRA Adapters that allow the model to generate task-specific embeddings (e.g., for retrieval vs. classification) without increasing inference latency significantly.
