VibeVoice ASR is an automatic speech recognition model from Microsoft that combines acoustic and semantic audio tokenizers with a causal language model for robust speech-to-text transcription. The model uses VibeVoice's acoustic and semantic tokenizers that process audio at 24kHz, paired with a Qwen2-based language decoder for generating transcriptions. It can process up to 60 minutes of continuous audio input, supports customized hotwords, performs joint ASR/diarization/timestamping, and handles over 50 languages with code-switching support.

TimesFM 2.5 is a pretrained time-series foundation model that uses a decoder-only attention architecture with input patching for forecasting. The model is designed to provide accurate zero-shot forecasts across different domains, forecasting horizons and temporal granularities without requiring dataset-specific training. It builds on the original TimesFM architecture with enhancements including rotary attention, QK normalization, per-dimension attention scaling, and continuous quantile prediction.
