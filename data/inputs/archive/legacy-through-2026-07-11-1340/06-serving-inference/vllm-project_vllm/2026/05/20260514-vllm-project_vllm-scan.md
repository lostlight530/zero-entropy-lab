## Highlights

This release features 367 commits from 202 contributors (49 new)!

* **Transformers v4 deprecated**: This release formally deprecates `transformers` v4 support (#40389). Users should migrate to `transformers` v5.
* **C++20 build requirement**: vLLM now requires a C++20-compatible compiler for compatibility with PyTorch (#40380). This is a **breaking build change**.
* **KV Offload + Hybrid Memory Allocator (HMA)**: The KV offloading subsystem now integrates with the Hybrid Memory Allocator, including scheduler-side sliding window group support and full HMA enablement (#41228, #41445, #39571).
* **Speculative decoding with thinking budget**: Speculative decoding now respects reasoning/thinking budgets, enabling correct spec decode for reasoning models (#34668).
* **TOKENSPEED_MLA backend on Blackwell**: A new TOKENSPEED_MLA attention backend is available for DeepSeek-R1/Kimi-K25 prefill + decode on Blackwell GPUs (#41778).
