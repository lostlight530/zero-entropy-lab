## New Model additions

### Cohere2Moe

Command A+ is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model from Cohere that features a hybrid attention pattern combining sliding window and full attention layers. The model incorporates both shared and routed experts and supports a very large context window for processing extensive text sequences.

* Add new cohere2_moe model (#46115) by @Cyrilvallez in [#46115](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/46115)

### Parakeet tdt (#44171)

* Parakeet tdt (#44171) by @lmaksym

### HRM-Text

HRM-Text is an improved autoregressive language-modeling variant of the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) that uses a hierarchical recurrent forward pass with two transformer stacks - one for slow, abstract planning (H) and one for fast, detailed computation (L) - reused inside a nested recurrence. It features PrefixLM attention where instruction tokens attend bidirectionally while response tokens attend causally, per-head sigmoid output gates, and parameterless RMSNorm. The model is designed as a base language model without instruction tuning or chat templates.

* Add hrm text (#46025) by @abcd1927 in [#46025](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/46025)



## Breaking changes

The `text_embeds` input for SAM3, EdgeTAM, and SAM3-Lite-Text models now expects full text embeddings instead of just pooler outputs, aligning with other models in the library — users must update their inputs accordingly.
* 🚨Fix memory leaks caused by lru decorators in vision models (#45922) by @yonigozlan



## Audio

Audio support was expanded with the addition of AudioFlamingoNext model checkpoints and improved compilability of audio/vision encoders via standalone pure functions. Additional improvements include better error messaging when loading audio from video files and new documentation for audio/video processors.

* Extract dynamic vision/audio tensors into standalone pure functions (#45396) by @IlyasMoutawwakil in [#45396]


## Generation

Fixed generation issues including `inputs_embeds` and `per_layer_inputs` handling for Gemma4, an `AttributeError` in RAG's `generate()` caused by missing config fields, and flaky VLM generation tests by blocking special image tokens during sampling.
